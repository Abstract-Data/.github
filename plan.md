## Plan for Abstract Data README Enhancements

### 1. Structure
- Reorganize sections to communicate the breadth of Abstract Data initiatives rather than a single product.
- Consolidate redundant visuals (e.g., badges) while preserving impact near the top-level overview.
- Group capabilities into high-level pillars that map to multiple projects instead of package-specific features.

### 2. Content
- Update mission statement and intros to emphasize a portfolio of civic-tech projects (platforms, tooling, infrastructure).
- Highlight representative project categories (data infrastructure, compliance automation, engagement tooling, analytics) with concise summaries.
- Refresh differentiators/leadership content to reflect ecosystem strengths across the portfolio.
- Adjust service range descriptions to reinforce modular offerings rather than a monolithic platform.

### 3. Flow
- Present narrative as: who we are → portfolio overview → proof (metrics, deployments) → technical foundations → differentiators → services.
- Ensure dividers/visuals reinforce transitions without implying a single contiguous product.

### 4. Visual Assets
- Audit existing SVGs and reuse where they support broader storytelling (e.g., metrics dashboard, radar).
- Remove or retire assets that suggest package-specific functionality (e.g., coaching-specific cards).
- If new visuals are needed, design them to represent categories or systems instead of individual products.

### 5. Polish
- Update terminology to avoid “the platform” framing; use “systems,” “projects,” or “programs” as appropriate.
- Proofread for consistency, ensure alt text and captions reflect portfolio language.
- Verify all asset references are accurate after adjustments.
